
----Data Structure----
int A[10];    This will create memory inside stack 
int *A = new int[10];  This will create memory inside heap
When you have alot of data you can have alot of analytical work

Once created array size cannot be changed. 
Array are defultp in C++ but the problem is their sized is fixed.
connection of data stracture is called STL{standard template library}



___Container____Template class

1.vector  
-- array only(this not fixed size araray this can be grow and reduce by itself)
-- function avaliable in vector
        -- push-back() --for inserting
            pop-back() --for deleting 
            insert()
            remove ()
            size()
            empty()

2.list  
--linklist 
    linklist
--can expend and can reduce this means the size is variable.
double linklist can be forward and backward.
circular linklist- the last node is connected with the first linklist.
        --  push-front()
            pop-front()
            push-back() --for inserting
            pop-back() --for deleting 
            insert()
            remove ()
            size()
            empty()
            front()
            back()

3.forward-list
--single linklist only can forward.
    --same methods are avaliable as the list.
4.deque
--same as vector
        --push-front()
            pop-front()
            push-back() --for inserting
            pop-back() --for deleting 
            insert()
            remove ()
            size()
            empty()
            front()
            back()

5.priority-queus
--means that always the largest element form the queus will be deleted
--for heap data structure it is for max heap data structure
        --  push()
            pop()
            empty()
            size()

6.stack
--work on the descipline last in first out
       --  push()
            pop()
            empty()
            size()
7.Set 
--this is the collection of element which will contain only the unique element
--duplicate are not allowed.
8.multiset 
--same as set and this allowed deplicate

9.map
--can store <key:value> pair

10.multi-map
-same as map but duplicate keys are allowed but the value should be different.
